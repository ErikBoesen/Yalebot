<h3>A GroupMe chatbot for Yale University.</h3>
<p>Yalebot boasts a wide variety of capabilities, including meme generation, face-recognition photo filters, inspirational quote generation, fun facts, and verification that a user is Yale-affiliated. It is an ideal tool for Yale GroupMe chats (although it's also active in non-Yale chats, such as those of the University of Pennsylvania, Ivy League 2023, University of Michigan, etc.). The bot is maintained by <a href="https://erikboesen.com"</a>Erik Boesen</a> '23.</p>
