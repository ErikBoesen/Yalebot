For everyone asking about APs, here is the table of ways to earn acceleration credits: https://yalecollege.yale.edu/academics/acceleration/table-acceleration-credit. Here is the official Yale College Programs of Study (i.e. Blue Book) rules about acceleration: http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/academic-regulations/acceleration-policies/. Students are also able to take placement exams over the summer to ensure that they're going into the appropriate math and language course levels. The choice to take this year's AP exams is ultimately yours. (Not just saying that due to 'rona. We don't require students to take their AP exams. Your admissions will not be affected negatively by you opting out of the AP exams.) Acceleration (AP) credit can help give a student flexibility in the event that she wants to take a semester off, or take advantage of a unique opportunity that would require taking fewer credits another semester... there are lots of scenarios where extra credits could come in handy.
